# Registration
List of emails can be imported as an Excel file and an account is automatically created. Users will receive an email with an activation link. A password can be created when clicking on the activation link. On first login, users will be prompted for their name, level of training and school of anaesthesia (form fields can be prefilled if information is provided in the Excel file - users would just need to check and confirm).

## 1.2 Select the correct school and training grade
Users select their default school and training grade when registering their account. The list of teaching events is filtered based on what the user selected on registration. This can be changed by clicking on the dropdown boxes (see screenshot). This is useful for trainers and admins as they can quickly look at the teaching programs for different schools and training grades.

If a trainee moves to a different school or progresses to the next training grade, they can change the default value by ticking the “Save as default” checkbox. This currently requires an internet connection.

# Trainer
* Once an admin adds a trainer to the teaching session, it will show up in their events. Just like trainees, trainers can view their teaching events by
	* Going to the My Events card on the home tab
	* Navigating to the “Events” tab
	* Navigating to the “Teaching” tab. When scrolling to the teaching session, it will show ”You are teaching” underneath the teaching session.

<img src="./img/teaching_tab_you_are_teaching.png" width="300">

* Clicking on the teaching event will bring up the event page:

<img src="./img/trainer_event_view.png" width="300">
 
* Trainees can be marked as “Did not attend” and “Attended” by using the buttons shown below. Buttons will become active once one or more trainees are selected.
* The “Confirm all” button is active all the time and allows the trainer to mark all trainees as attended, without selecting each one. This will not affect trainees who have already been selected as “Did not attend”. If they have been marked as did not attend by mistake, the trainer has to select the trainee and click the “Confirm” button.
* If required, trainers can download an attendance sheet as a PDF file and print this if required. If the app has been installed on an iPhone, the PDF button will email the PDF file to the trainer as Apple do not allow opening PDF files on installed web apps.

<img src="./img/trainer_event_view_dna.png" width="300">
<img src="./img/trainer_event_view_confirmed.png" width="300">

* The event page will also show the feedback provided by trainees for the teaching session. Trainer must mark trainees as attended for them to be able to submit feedback. Feedback provided is anonymous and there is no way to allow admins or training leads to trace back feedback to a trainee.
* Feedback can be downloaded as a PDF file. If the app has been installed on an iPhone, the PDF button will email the PDF file to the trainer as Apple do not allow opening PDF files on installed web apps.
